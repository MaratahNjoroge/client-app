          <div class="text-lg">
            <p>After 60 years of tribal, corrupt, unprincipled, incompetent and short sighted selfish leadership, August 9, 2022 is the time for fresh, new, honest, principled, competent and visionary leadership that will deliver on  jobs, housing, education, healthcare, business, end corruption, end injustice and end tribalism. 
              Chama Cha Mimi Na Wewe is an all inclusive political party that has been formed to address the challenges that face Kenya and her citizens. We plan to play our part in coming up with solutions that can lead to a better Kenya.
            </p>
            <h1>Part of our agenda includes;</h1>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Wanjiku Bill</strong>  </li>
              <p>All elected officials to be put on a performance contract whereby their monthly salary will be pegged on maintaining unemployment rate below 5%.</p>
              <li><strong>Creation of employment for all Kenyans</strong> </li>
              <p><ul>
                  <li>Lay infrastructure across Kenya i.e. piped water and sewerage, mixture of murram and tarmac roads, fiber and electricity. This will cut down the cost of construction for public and public developers leading to the construction of houses, offices, business and leisure facilities across the country that will result in employment creation. </li>
                  <li>Develop agri-business through provision of irrigation, affordable loans, research and easy access to markets.</li>
                  <li>Facilitate construction of at least 0.5 million houses annually by adapting reliable and affordable technology.</li>
                  <li>Set up economic and industrial zones at county levels to provide an enabling environment for manufacturing.</li>
                  <li>Support SME’s through the provision of affordable loans. </li>
              </ul></p>
              <li><strong>Facilitate the construction of 0.5 million houses yearly.</strong></li>
              <li><strong>A lean, professional, efficient, and inclusive civil service. </strong></li>
              <li><strong>Transparency, accountability, and public participation in public affairs.</strong></li>
                <p><ul><li>
                  SMS is one of the most cost-effective, efficient, and inclusive means of communication. To leverage this, citizens will have an opportunity to have their voices heard in public affairs through SMS. <br> All decisions whether legislative or executive that has been debated upon will finally be approved by the public through SMS voting. <br> Every Friday of every week, matters 
                  that need to be voted on whether from the legislature or the executive will be published and members of the public will vote on them. Eventually, this will also include elections. Electing leaders and recalling non-performing leaders will be as simple and cost-effective as sending an SMS. <br> This will cut down on cost, increase public participation and hold elected leaders to account.  My Tax, My Voice.                 
                </li></ul></p>

                  Scientific innovations resulting in products that have a global demand have led to rapid developments in countries like USA, Germany, Japan, Korea etc. 
                  In Kenya we have talented individuals who are capable of coming up with new inventions but what has been lacking is funding for research and developments. 
                  This is evident in the annual secondary school’s science congress and scientific exhibitions in our colleges and universities. 
                  Our government will set up a 1 billion shillings research and development fund. Annual science fairs open to all will be held and the top 100 inventions with likelihood of producing usable products and in the process create employment, will receive a grant of Ksh 10 million each. 
                  Inventors will be assisted to solicit additional funds from investors and banks.
